About Me:

Title: Hi I'm Fernando
Paragraph: In 2020, I came to Taiwan to study computer science,
but due to COVID and other challenges, I had to start self-learning in my second year. After three years of learning on my own, I landed an internship at Nuli App, which turned into a full-time web developer role after graduation.

Having faced the struggles of learning web development, I started teaching beginners to help teenagers and university students learn more effectively. By sharing my knowledge, I aim to help others develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills, making their learning journey clearer and more productive.
